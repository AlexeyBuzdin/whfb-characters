    Name                   | CN  | Time  | Inredient            | Description
---------------------------|-----|-------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Glowing light              | 3   | half  |                      |You can cause any item in your grasp to glow with the light of a lantern for one hour or until you let it go.
Sounds                     | 4   | half  |                      |You can create a phantom noise with this spell, with volume ranging from a whisper to a roar. You can choose the type of noise and the volume; the spell can reproduce any type of noise but speech. The noise can last for up to one round.
Drop                       | 4   | half  |                      |You compel a target character within 24 yards (12 squares) to drop whatever he is holding. The subject of this spell can resist it with a successful Will Power Test.
Sleep                      | 6   | half  |                      |Your touch causes one opponent to fall into a slumber for 1d10 rounds unless a successful Will Power Test is made. Sleeping characters are considered to be helpless. Sleep is a touch spell.
Marsh lights               | 6   | full  |                      |You create the appearance of a number of distant lights that suggest torches or lanterns. They appear within 100 yards (50 squares) of you and can then be sent off in any direction. They naturally follow corridors or paths and do not need to be controlled or overseen in any way. You can control them more closely if desired, but only as long as they remain in line of sight. You canâ€™t perform any other actions while controlling the lights. The lights travel at various speeds, but never slower than 8 yards (4 squares) per round or faster than 16 yards (8 squares) per round. They last for one hour, and then gradually fade and vanish.
Magic dart                 | 6   | half  |                      |You throw a dart of magical force at an opponent within 16 yards (8 squares). Although small, the magic dart strikes with considerable force. A magic dart is magic missile with Damage 3.
