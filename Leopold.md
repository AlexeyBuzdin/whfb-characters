### Spells (tzeentch)
    Name                   | CN |  Time | Ingredient         | Description
---------------------------|----|-------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Boon of Chaos              |  9 |  full | An amulet engraved with the symbol of one of the Gods of Chaos (+1) | You call upon the favour of the Dark Gods of Chaos. You gain a +10% bonus to Weapon Skill, Toughness, Will Power, or Fellowship for one minute (6 rounds).
Burning Blood              | 13 |  half | A vial of Daemon blood (+2) | You spit blood that burns like acid at any one target within 24 yards (12 squares). The target suffers a number of Damage 4 hits equal to your Magic Characteristic. This is a magic missile.
Dark Hand of Destruction   | 17 |  full | The hand of a hanged man (+2) | You wreath your hand in a nimbus of Dark Magic. It counts as a magic weapon with the Armour Piercing Quality and Damage 7, and you gain a +10% bonus to your Weapon Skill when attacking with it. The spell remains in effect for a number of rounds equal to your Magic Characteristic. You can retain it with a successful Will Power Test each round thereafter.
Lure of Chaos              | 16 |  full | A defiled holy symbol (+2) | You bewitch one character with 24 yards (12 squares) and bend him to your will. Unless the target makes a successful Will Power Test, you decide what he does on his next turn. Any commands that would be deemed suicidal grant the Character an additional Will Power Test to break the hold of this spell. Undead are immune to the lure of Chaos.
Pink Fire of Tzeentch      | 15 |  half | Flaming arrow (+2) | Guttering flames of pink energy spew forth from your fingertips and strike a single creature within 6 yards (3 squares). This is a magic missile that causes two Damage 4 hits that ignore armour.
Touch of Chaos             | 20 |  half | The horn of a Beastman (+2) | Your touch channels pure Chaos energy into one target, causing him to mutate and change unless a successful Will Power Test is made. If the test is failed the target gains one mutation. The mutation manifests in a matter of seconds and is permanent. If affected, the target must also make a successful Will Power Test or be stunned for 1 round by the suddenness and vileness of the change. This is a touch spell. Undead are immune to the touch of Chaos.
Transformation of Tzeentch | 18 |  full | The heart of a Mutant (+2) | Select a single target within 12 yards (6 squares). That target must succeed on a Routine (+10%) Will Power Test or collapse as his body undergoes a series of horrific transformations. Each round, for a number of rounds equal to your Magic Characteristic, the target must succeed on a Routine (+10%) Toughness Test. When the spell expires, the target gains one mutation for each failed Toughness Test. Whilst under the effect of this spell, the target is considered helpless.
Tzeentch’s Fire Storm      | 25 | 2full | A bonfire made from the bones of 13 Mutants (+3) | You cause a blasphemous storm of purple flame to erupt anywhere you designate within 24 yards (12 squares). Use the large template. All creatures under the template take four Damage 4 hits. Those slain by Tzeentch’s fire storm are incinerated, transformed into pink ash that blows away in the wind. But that’s not all. The ashes swirl about for 2 rounds and finally coalesce into Pink Horrors of Tzeentch, one for each victim slain. These creatures are not under your control, and they attack the closest creatures to them. They eventually grow weary of this world and return to the Realm of Chaos after 1d10 rounds.
Veil of Corruption         | 24 |  full | The blade of a Chaos Champion (+3) | You create a foul cloud of corruption anywhere within 36 yards (18 squares). Use the large template. Those affected must make a Will Power Test or lose 1 Wound regardless of Toughness Bonus or armour. Wounded characters continue to lose 1 Wound per round until a successful Will Power Test is made. Those who suffer more than 1 Wound must also make a Toughness Test or begin to mutate. Those who fail the test gain one mutation. Undead do not gain mutations, but are otherwise affected by this spell.
Vision of Torment          |  7 |  half | A small mask (+1) | You cause any one character within 24 yards (12 squares) to have a hellish vision. The target is stunned for 1 round unless a successful Will Power Test is made. Once the character recovers from being stunned, he must make a second Will Power Test or gain 1 Insanity Point.

### Spells (petty chaos)
    Name                   | CN |  Time | Ingredient         | Description
---------------------------|----|-------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Befuddle                   |  4 |  half | A bud of Black Lotus (+1) | Your touch causes one opponent to become drowsy and giggly for 1d10 rounds unless he succeeds on a Will Power Test. Whilst affected, the opponent takes a –20% to all Characteristics and Skill Tests. Befuddle is a touch spell.
Blessing of the Master     |  6 |  half | Pint of blood from a child (+1) | You call upon the might of Daemons to grant you a boon. Increase one of your Characteristics by +10% for a number of minutes equal to your Magic Characteristic.
Burn                       |  4 |  half | A bit of ash from a spent torch (+1) | You cause a spark to fly from your fingertip to land anywhere you wish within 8 yards (4 squares). The spark deals no damage, but if left to its own devices and if it lands on a flammable object, that object catches fire in 1d10 rounds. See Fire in WFRP page 136
Curse                      |  6 |  full | A fingernail from the victim (+1) | You place a curse on one chosen victim within 12 yards (6 squares). The victim is entitled to a Will Power Test to resist the spell’s effect. The curse is annoying and is in no way lethal nor causes any penalties aside from some mild discomfort and perhaps a minor penalty on Fellowship Tests (no more than –10% as the GM decides). Example curses include: warts, boils, change in hair colour, uncontrollable flatulence, smelly feet, nasty rash, and so on. Curse lasts for one day.
Eyes of Clarity            |  6 |  half | The eye of a man hanged for three days (+1) | Your eyes glow with an unholy green light, enabling youto see as if you had the Night Vision Talent for one hour per pointof your Magic Characteristic. If you already have the Night VisionTalent, the range of your vision doubles. See Illumination in WFRP page 117 for details.
Spew                       |  3 |  half | Thimble of Troll vomit (+1) | You force a target within 8 yards (4 squares) to spit up a little vomit unless he succeeds on a Toughness Test. The target takesa –10% penalty to all Fellowship Tests involving social situations for the next 1d10 rounds.
