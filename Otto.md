Illusion of Normality      | A powerful magic conceals all evidence of your mutations. You retain any penalties or benefits from the mutations, but so long as you remain out of combat, you are indistinguishable from any other of your former race. When engaged in melee combat, your opponent automatically sees you for what you are, and if you have the Frightening or Terrifying Talents, you resolve Fear and Terror Tests then.

# Spells (shadow)
    Name                   | CN  | Inridient            | Description
---------------------------|-----|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Cloak Activity             | 12  |                      | This spell allows you to perform any act while appearing to do something completely different. You appear to be exactly where you are, but engaged in a different activity. For example, you can appear to all eyes to be reading a book when you are actually punching someone in the face. If your action affects someone else (an attack, spell, picking a pocket, etc.), the victim is allowed an Intelligence Test to see through the illusion. Cloak activity lasts for 1d10 rounds. If cast successfully, cloak activity also disguises the act of casting the spell.
Doppelganger               |  7  |                      |You can take on the appearance (including clothing, armour, and so on) of any other living, humanoid creature under ten feet in height (Human, Elf, Orc, etc.) for a number of minutes equal to ten times your Magic Characteristic. The spell does not disguise your voice, only your appearance. You may look like an Orc, for instance, but if you can’t speak the Goblin Tongue, it’s best to keep your mouth shut around Greenskins. Should you somehow act in a suspicious manner, viewers are allowed an Intelligence Test to see through the illusion. If you want to look like a specific individual, you must make a successful Channelling Test to perfect the disguise. Otherwise, you look like an undistinguished member of the same race.
Eye of the Beholder        |  6  |                      | You make any moderately sized item (Encumbrance 75 or less) appear to be either worthless or valuable, whichever you choose. Worthless items appear rusted, rotten, broken, or the like, depending on their nature, while valuable items appear to be finely made, ornate, and crafted with great ingenuity. The apparent flaws or virtues of the item do not affect its actual behaviour: A normal sword enchanted to appear worthless still cuts just fine, and a crooked arrow enchanted to appear masterfully crafted doesn’t fly any more true. Tests to appraise the item whose nature is concealed by this spell suffer a –20% penalty. This effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your Magic Characteristic.
Illusion                   | 24  |                      |You create an illusion anywhere within 48 yards (24 squares) that is a nearly perfect simulation of reality, complete with sight, sound, and smell. Use the large template. You can make this area look like anything. Illusion lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Magic Characteristic, but you can keep it going with a successful Will Power Test each subsequent round. You must spend a half action each round maintaining the illusion. Furthermore, you cannot cast any other spells or the illusion disappears immediately. Viewers may be allowed an Intelligence Test to see through the illusion if they have cause to suspect it’s a trick. The precise effects of the illusion are up to the GM to determine and should follow the guidelines of common sense
Mindhole                   |  8  |                      | You cause one character within 48 yards (24 squares) of you to wholly forget you exist. If the target fails an Opposed Will Power Test with you, all knowledge and memory of your existence is wiped from his mind. He can still notice you as normal and remember anything so perceived going forward.
Mockery of Death           | 18  |                      | You cause someone to appear and behave as if dead to all sight and inspection. That person continues to sense his environment through hearing, smell, and—if his eyes are open—sight, but he cannot move his body in any way whatsoever until the spell ends. However, he continues to require air and other essentials of life. This state persists until you will it to end or until a number of days pass equal to your Magic Characteristic. An unwilling target can resist the spell with a successful Will Power Test. You can also cast this spell on yourself. This is a touch spell.
Shadow Knives              | 22  |                      | You conjure up a number of shadow knives equal to your Magic Characteristic and can hurl them at one or more opponents within 48 yards (24 squares). Shadow knives are magic missiles with Damage 3. Furthermore, their shadow nature means that all non-magic armour is ignored when reducing damage.
Shadowsteed                | 11  |                      | You call forth a dark and shadowy horse who will bear you and a minimum of gear (no more than you yourself can carry without penalty) noiselessly and at great speed until you stop riding or until the next day’s first light dawns. The horse has the statistics of a normal riding horse (see WFRP, page 233) but also has the Concealment skill (which it uses at a +30% bonus) and the Navigation skill. Further, the shadowsteed travels at top speed without fatigue, bearing you half again faster than a normal riding horse would be able. When the spell’s duration expires, the horse vanishes around a corner, into a shadow, or in a similar manner. You can also designate another individual that the steed will bear instead of you.
Shroud of Invisibility     | 17  |                      | You shroud yourself with magic and disappear from sight for 1d10 rounds. While you are invisible, you can’t be targeted with ranged attacks, including magic missiles. Any melee attacks you make receive a +20% Weapon Skill bonus. Anyone within 4 yards (2 squares) of you can make a Hard (–20%) Perception Skill Test to detect you using non-visual senses. If a successful test is made, you can be attacked, but attackers suffer a –30% penalty to Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill as appropriate. You cannot cast this spell on others.
Throttling                 | 13  |                      | You send ropes of inky darkness to throttle any one target within 12 yards (6 squares), cutting off his ability to breathe entirely and forcing him to make a Toughness Test to resist the effects the spell. You can maintain this spell with a half action on each subsequent round, but you may cast no further spells while doing so. If you maintain the spell, the Toughness Test is modified a cumulative –10% penalty each round until it is failed, at which point the target begins to take damage. The first round of failure causes a Damage 1 hit that ignores Armour, and each subsequent round the Damage of the hit increases by 1. No additional Toughness Tests are allowed to resist damage after the first has been failed; the damage simply continues to compound until you stop, or are forced to stop, concentrating on the spell. The rules for concentration (see WFRP, Spellcasting Limits, page 144) apply.
