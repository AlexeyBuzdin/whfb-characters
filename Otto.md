Illusion of Normality      | A powerful magic conceals all evidence of your mutations.

When engaged in melee combat, your opponent automatically sees you for what you are, and if you have the Frightening or Terrifying Talents, you resolve Fear and Terror Tests then.

### Spells (shadow)
    Name                   | CN  | Time | Inredient            | Description
---------------------------|-----|------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Cloak Activity             | 12  |half  | A sketch of your illusory action (+2)  | This spell allows you to perform any act while appearing to do something completely different. You appear to be exactly where you are, but engaged in a different activity. For example, you can appear to all eyes to be reading a book when you are actually punching someone in the face. If your action affects someone else (an attack, spell, picking a pocket, etc.), the victim is allowed an Intelligence Test to see through the illusion. Cloak activity lasts for 1d10 rounds. If cast successfully, cloak activity also disguises the act of casting the spell.
Doppelganger               |  7  |1.5   |A lock of hair from a member of the race you are impersonating (+1) |You can take on the appearance (including clothing, armour, and so on) of any other living, humanoid creature under ten feet in height (Human, Elf, Orc, etc.) for a number of minutes equal to ten times your Magic Characteristic. The spell does not disguise your voice, only your appearance. You may look like an Orc, for instance, but if you can’t speak the Goblin Tongue, it’s best to keep your mouth shut around Greenskins. Should you somehow act in a suspicious manner, viewers are allowed an Intelligence Test to see through the illusion. If you want to look like a specific individual, you must make a successful Channelling Test to perfect the disguise. Otherwise, you look like an undistinguished member of the same race.
Eye of the Beholder        |  6  |half  |A monstrous eyeball (+1) | You make any moderately sized item (Encumbrance 75 or less) appear to be either worthless or valuable, whichever you choose. Worthless items appear rusted, rotten, broken, or the like, depending on their nature, while valuable items appear to be finely made, ornate, and crafted with great ingenuity. The apparent flaws or virtues of the item do not affect its actual behaviour: A normal sword enchanted to appear worthless still cuts just fine, and a crooked arrow enchanted to appear masterfully crafted doesn’t fly any more true. Tests to appraise the item whose nature is concealed by this spell suffer a –20% penalty. This effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your Magic Characteristic.
Illusion                   | 24  | 1.5 |A crystal prism (+3) |You create an illusion anywhere within 48 yards (24 squares) that is a nearly perfect simulation of reality, complete with sight, sound, and smell. Use the large template. You can make this area look like anything. Illusion lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Magic Characteristic, but you can keep it going with a successful Will Power Test each subsequent round. You must spend a half action each round maintaining the illusion. Furthermore, you cannot cast any other spells or the illusion disappears immediately. Viewers may be allowed an Intelligence Test to see through the illusion if they have cause to suspect it’s a trick. The precise effects of the illusion are up to the GM to determine and should follow the guidelines of common sense
Mindhole                   |8    |half |Fingernail clippings of the person to be forgotten (+1) | You cause one character within 48 yards (24 squares) of you to wholly forget you exist. If the target fails an Opposed Will Power Test with you, all knowledge and memory of your existence is wiped from his mind. He can still notice you as normal and remember anything so perceived going forward.
Mockery of Death           |18   |full |A corpse shroud buried at least a year (+2) | You cause someone to appear and behave as if dead to all sight and inspection. That person continues to sense his environment through hearing, smell, and—if his eyes are open—sight, but he cannot move his body in any way whatsoever until the spell ends. However, he continues to require air and other essentials of life. This state persists until you will it to end or until a number of days pass equal to your Magic Characteristic. An unwilling target can resist the spell with a successful Will Power Test. You can also cast this spell on yourself. This is a touch spell.
Shadow Knives              | 22  |half | A knife of cold-forged iron (+3) | You conjure up a number of shadow knives equal to your Magic Characteristic and can hurl them at one or more opponents within 48 yards (24 squares). Shadow knives are magic missiles with Damage 3. Furthermore, their shadow nature means that all non-magic armour is ignored when reducing damage.
Shadowsteed                | 11   |full |  A chip of hoof from a well-travelled horse (+2) | You call forth a dark and shadowy horse who will bear you and a minimum of gear (no more than you yourself can carry without penalty) noiselessly and at great speed until you stop riding or until the next day’s first light dawns. The horse has the statistics of a normal riding horse (see WFRP, page 233) but also has the Concealment skill (which it uses at a +30% bonus) and the Navigation skill. Further, the shadowsteed travels at top speed without fatigue, bearing you half again faster than a normal riding horse would be able. When the spell’s duration expires, the horse vanishes around a corner, into a shadow, or in a similar manner. You can also designate another individual that the steed will bear instead of you.
Shroud of Invisibility     | 17   |full | A gossamer shroud (+2)| You shroud yourself with magic and disappear from sight for 1d10 rounds. While you are invisible, you can’t be targeted with ranged attacks, including magic missiles. Any melee attacks you make receive a +20% Weapon Skill bonus. Anyone within 4 yards (2 squares) of you can make a Hard (–20%) Perception Skill Test to detect you using non-visual senses. If a successful test is made, you can be attacked, but attackers suffer a –30% penalty to Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill as appropriate. You cannot cast this spell on others.
Throttling                 | 13  |full  | A garrotte that has been used to strangle a man (+2) | You send ropes of inky darkness to throttle any one target within 12 yards (6 squares), cutting off his ability to breathe entirely and forcing him to make a Toughness Test to resist the effects the spell. You can maintain this spell with a half action on each subsequent round, but you may cast no further spells while doing so. If you maintain the spell, the Toughness Test is modified a cumulative –10% penalty each round until it is failed, at which point the target begins to take damage. The first round of failure causes a Damage 1 hit that ignores Armour, and each subsequent round the Damage of the hit increases by 1. No additional Toughness Tests are allowed to resist damage after the first has been failed; the damage simply continues to compound until you stop, or are forced to stop, concentrating on the spell. The rules for concentration (see WFRP, Spellcasting Limits, page 144) apply.

### Spells (tzeentch)
    Name                   | CN  | Time | Inredient            | Description
---------------------------|-----|------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Destroy Magic              | 20  | 2full|The blood of a Horror (+2)| You intone the profane words of Daemons, drawing the energy found within a targeted magic item into yourself. A magic item of your choice within 6 yards (3 squares) immediately loses all magical properties for 1d10 minutes. You must succeed on a Challenging (–10%) Toughness Test or gain one mutation.
Dispel Mortal              | 30  | full |The eyes of a Wizard (+3)| Select one creature within 6 yards (3 squares). The target must succeed on a Very Hard (–30%) Will Power Test or be sucked into the Realm of Chaos to become the plaything of Daemons.
Flames of Fate             | 7   | full |A small meteorite (+1)| Pale orange flames spring up from the ground all around you. Contained within the flickering tongues of fire are images of the future. You may re-roll any Characteristic or Skill Test made within a number of minutes equal to your Magic Characteristic.
Mindfire                   |10   |half  |Cranial fluids from a madman (+2)| You cause a lance of magenta flame to leap forth from your hand and strike a single target within 48 yards (24 squares). This is a magic missile. If you hit, the target gains 1d10/2 Insanity Points if he has none. If he has Insanity Points, he instead loses 1d10/2 Insanity Points and takes a Damage 1 hit that ignores Toughness Bonus and armour. If you reduce the target’s Insanity Points to 0, they lose any insanities they’ve acquired.
Pink Fire of Tzeentch     | 15   |half  |Flaming arrow (+2)| Guttering flames of pink energy spew forth from your fingertips and strike a single creature within 6 yards (3 squares). This is a magic missile that causes two Damage 4 hits that ignore armour. 
Slave to Chaos            | 18   |half  |  A handful of sand (+2) | You send your consciousness into another living creature within 48 yards (24 squares). The subject of this psychic attack is entitled to a Will Power Test to resist your intrusion. On a failed test, you take control of the subject’s actions for a number of rounds equal to your Magic Characteristic × 2. If you command the subject to act in a suicidal way, the target receives another Will Power Test to break the effect. While in possession of a mortal body, your body lies in a deep sleep. When the spell ends, the subject must succeed on a Challenging (–10%) Will Power Test or gain one mutation.
Subvert Strength         | 11  |  2full | A bit of wax (+2) |  Your hand glows with queer blue spots. A nonmagical inanimate object you next touch loses its hardness, becoming soft and malleable. Steel bends, glass folds, rock becomes putty. If you cast this spell on a weapon, it bends or even breaks if used in combat. On armour, it ceases to offer protection, losing all armour points in the affected location (and if it takes a hit, armour there is destroyed). You may only affect an object of up to two cubic yards. You can shape this material as you like, though the GM may require an appropriate Trade Test. The object remains soft and wax-like for a number of minutes equal to your Magic Characteristic.
Transformation of Tztch. |  18 |  full  | The heart of a Mutant (+2) | Select a single target within 12 yards (6 squares). That target must succeed on a Routine (+10%) Will Power Test or collapse as his body undergoes a series of horrific transformations. Each round, for a number of rounds equal to your Magic Characteristic, the target must succeed on a Routine (+10%) Toughness Test. When the spell expires, the target gains one mutation for each failed Toughness Test. Whilst under the effect of this spell, the target is considered helpless.
Tzeentch’s Blessing      | 18  | full  | The finger of a Wizard (+2) | You cry out to Tzeentch for the Dark God’s blessing. Roll 1d10. On an odd number, you gain one mutation. On an even number you may add one spell from any Lore to your repertoire for one day.
Tzeentch’s Fire Storm    | 25  | 2full | A bonfire made from the bones of 13 Mutants (+3) | You cause a blasphemous storm of purple flame to erupt anywhere you designate within 24 yards (12 squares). Use the large template. All creatures under the template take four Damage 4 hits. Those slain by Tzeentch’s fire storm are incinerated, transformed into pink ash that blows away in the wind. But that’s not all. The ashes swirl about for 2 rounds and finally coalesce into Pink Horrors of Tzeentch, one for each victim slain. These creatures are not under your control, and they attack the closest creatures to them. They eventually grow weary of this world and return to the Realm of Chaos after 1d10 rounds.

### Spells (petty arcane)
    Name                   | CN  | Time  | Inredient            | Description
---------------------------|-----|-------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Glowing light              | 3   | half  |                      |You can cause any item in your grasp to glow with the light of a lantern for one hour or until you let it go.
Sounds                     | 4   | half  |                      |You can create a phantom noise with this spell, with volume ranging from a whisper to a roar. You can choose the type of noise and the volume; the spell can reproduce any type of noise but speech. The noise can last for up to one round.
Drop                       | 4   | half  |                      |You compel a target character within 24 yards (12 squares) to drop whatever he is holding. The subject of this spell can resist it with a successful Will Power Test.
Sleep                      | 6   | half  |                      |Your touch causes one opponent to fall into a slumber for 1d10 rounds unless a successful Will Power Test is made. Sleeping characters are considered to be helpless. Sleep is a touch spell.
Marsh lights               | 6   | full  |                      |You create the appearance of a number of distant lights that suggest torches or lanterns. They appear within 100 yards (50 squares) of you and can then be sent off in any direction. They naturally follow corridors or paths and do not need to be controlled or overseen in any way. You can control them more closely if desired, but only as long as they remain in line of sight. You can’t perform any other actions while controlling the lights. The lights travel at various speeds, but never slower than 8 yards (4 squares) per round or faster than 16 yards (8 squares) per round. They last for one hour, and then gradually fade and vanish.
Magic dart                 | 6   | half  |                      |You throw a dart of magical force at an opponent within 16 yards (8 squares). Although small, the magic dart strikes with considerable force. A magic dart is magic missile with Damage 3.

### Spells (petty chaos)
    Name                   | CN  | Time  | Inredient            | Description
---------------------------|-----|-------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------
Befuddle                   | 4   | half  | A bud of Black Lotus (+1) |Your touch causes one opponent to become drowsy and giggly for 1d10 rounds unless he succeeds on a Will Power Test. Whilst affected, the opponent takes a –20% to all Characteristics and Skill Tests. Befuddle is a touch spell.
Blessing of the Master     | 6   | half  | Pint of blood from a child (+1) |You call upon the might of Daemons to grant you a boon. Increase one of your Characteristics by +10% for a number of minutes equal to your Magic Characteristic.
Burn                       | 4   | half  | A bit of ash from a spent torch (+1) |You cause a spark to fly from your fingertip to land anywhere you wish within 8 yards (4 squares). The spark deals no damage, but if left to its own devices and if it lands on a flammable object, that object catches fire in 1d10 rounds. See Fire in WFRP page 136
Curse                      | 6   | full  | A fingernail from the victim (+1) |You place a curse on one chosen victim within 12 yards (6 squares). The victim is entitled to a Will Power Test to resist the spell’s effect. The curse is annoying and is in no way lethal nor causes any penalties aside from some mild discomfort and perhaps a minor penalty on Fellowship Tests (no more than –10% as the GM decides). Example curses include: warts, boils, change in hair colour, uncontrollable flatulence, smelly feet, nasty rash, and so on. Curse lasts for one day.
Eyes of Clarity            | 6   | half  | The eye of a man hanged for three days (+1) |Your eyes glow with an unholy green light, enabling youto see as if you had the Night Vision Talent for one hour per pointof your Magic Characteristic. If you already have the Night VisionTalent, the range of your vision doubles. See Illumination in WFRP page 117 for details.
Spew                       | 3   | half  |Thimble of Troll vomit (+1)|You force a target within 8 yards (4 squares) to spit up a little vomit unless he succeeds on a Toughness Test. The target takesa –10% penalty to all Fellowship Tests involving social situations for the next 1d10 rounds.
